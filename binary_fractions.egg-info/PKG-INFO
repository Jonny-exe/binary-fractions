Description: # Binary fractions
        
        This is really small package to handle binary fractions.
        
        It has 2 functions:
          - float2bin, which converts floats to binary fractions represented in strings
          - bin2float, which converts binary fractions represented in strings to floats
        
        
        ```
        valid binary fraction: "100111.110001"
        
        float2bin:
          arguments: (float_number: float)
          optional_argument: (binary_places: int) # This specifies the precision of the returned bin. Default 50
        
        bin2float:
          arguments: (bin_number: string)
        
        ```
